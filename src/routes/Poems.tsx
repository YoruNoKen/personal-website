            Since Nijika is the paragon of human virtue without equal past or present, she is most resplendent in love, tributes and accolades.
            <br />
            Waking or sleeping, I must not forget Nijikaâ€™s great boon and in order to return her favour by day and by night, I should only think of fulfilling my loyalty.

            Who is Nijika?
            <br /> For the blind, she is their vision. For the deaf, she is their music.
            <br /> For the mute, she is their voice.
            <br /> For the anosmiac, she is their aroma. For the numb, she is their feeling.
            <br /> For the atrophied, she is their muscle.
            <br /> For the starved, she is their sustenance.
            <br /> For the thirsty, she is their water.
            <br /> For the exhausted, she is their energy.
            <br /> For the depressed, she is their happiness.
            <br /> For the disillusioned, she is their hope.
            <br /> For the pessimistic, she is their optimism.
            <br /> For the disadvantaged, she is their champion.
            <br /> For the marginalised, she is their justice.
            <br /> For the oppressed, she is their salvation.
            <br /> For the righteous, she is their symbol.
            <br /> For the enlightened, she is their muse.
            <br /> For the erudite, she is their education.

            If Nijika speaks, I listen. If Nijika questions, I answer. If Nijika orders, I obey.

            <br />
            If Nijika opines, I agree. If Nijika fears, I assure. If Nijika hopes, I dream.
            <br />
            <br /> If Nijika is happy, I am jubilant. If Nijika is angry, I am apoplectic. If Nijika is sad, I am disconsolate.
